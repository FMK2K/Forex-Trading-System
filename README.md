# **Forex Algorithmic Autotrader Project**

## **Introduction**
This project was developed as part of my personal exploration into financial markets and algorithmic trading. The goal was to create an automated trading system that could analyze and execute various strategies on Forex currency pairs using historical data. The project provided hands-on experience with developing, backtesting, and refining trading strategies using Python and Pandas, with a focus on technical indicators and data-driven decision-making.

## **Project Description**
The Algorithmic Autotrader applies multiple trading strategies to historical Forex data, automating the process of trade signal generation and performance evaluation. Strategies such as Cross Moving Average, RSI Scalping, and Fibonacci Retracement were implemented to test the systemâ€™s ability to identify profitable buy/sell signals. The autotrader generates detailed reports on trade outcomes, including profitability and total returns.

This project helped to deepen my understanding of financial markets, data analysis, and trading algorithms, while also enhancing my programming skills in Python. By incorporating real-time data and advanced technical indicators, the project also introduced concepts like dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels to optimize entry and exit points.

## **Key Features**
- **Automated Trade Simulation:** The system automates the entire trading process from data extraction to strategy implementation and backtesting.
- **Multiple Strategies:** Includes support for Cross Moving Average, Fibonacci Retracement, and RSI Scalping, with plans to add more advanced strategies.
- **Backtesting and Reporting:** Trades are backtested on historical data, and the system generates detailed Excel reports summarizing performance, profitability, and overall returns.
- **Dynamic Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels:** The project features customizable stop-loss and take-profit levels to refine entry and exit points for each strategy.
- **Real-Time Data:** Integrated with the OANDA API for real-time Forex data extraction, enabling the system to simulate high-frequency trading environments.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data Sources:** OANDA API for real-time Forex data
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Excel for report generation
